I did it using SwiftUI because I kind of wanted to practice, so I used this process as an excuse hahaha (yes, I'm taking advantage of not having any specifications on that lol)
I could have made it using storyboards, and it would have been a lot easier (although it wouldn't have been so cool)

RS = RockSpoon
I don't like when a API-result class has a common name like "Price", so I always put a prefix like RS so I won't be bothered
