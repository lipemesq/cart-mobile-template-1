Hi! Welcome to paradise-where-Felipe-explains-everything!

>> this project was done in just a few days as part of a selection process. To be honest, more than half the time spent was creating the design on Figma, solving SwiftUI bugs and getting irritate with the API results.

Well, the first and most shocking topic is that I've chosen to do this in swiftUI because (I am a masochist) I saw it as an excuse to train and learn and pratice it. I could easily get to the same app with UIKit, if that worries you in any way (and it would be less painful).

I was really annoyed with the data on the server. You (yes, you, who are reading this right now) could have arranged the data for me :( . As the data was a mess I used the "Decodable" protocol to do everything manually and only use whatever was minimally necessary (this implies that on the item's screen I make a request to get a single blessed parameter, what a nastiness)

>>>> I designed the screens (and it took work, I'm not fast/good in design), and you can look at the prototype and understand a little about the process in Figma with this link: https://www.figma.com/file/UTOjBEEdOoS5YkSHwtQzGY/Felipe-Cart-from-iOS-Design-System?node-id=47%3A1 <<<<

SwiftUI has many (many) bugs, so it is normal for the code to appear more complex than necessary, as there are many "workarounds".

I had fun doing it and I'm probably going to use it in my portfolio, so here it is.

If you want to talk to me about the code (OR DESIGN) to give feedback you are very welcome (really, especially if you are a senior). You can get my phone with dear Julia (a hug for Julia!), who called me on linkedIn

See you, space cowboy!



PS:
RS = RockSpoon
I don't like when a API-result class has a common name like "Price", so I always put a prefix like RS so I won't be bothered

PS 3:
>>>>>> This project use: Fastlane, Moya (not rx because: swiftUI), image caching, change orientation, most of apple guidelines (I ignored the font sizes, mainly), nice error feedbacks and error treatments, extra info about the items, Core Location, A SUPER USABLE AND CHARMING DESIGN, User Defaults and... 
oh, I could have made a better loading animation, but right now is 7 a.m and I'm tired after coding from so many hours.

PS 4:
I accept a PS 4, but I do prefer a PS 5, because I want to play the new God of War =]
